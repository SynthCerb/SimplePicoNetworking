# SimplePicoNetworking
Wrapper class to simplify use of networking with the Raspberry Pico microcontroller 


Very much a work in progress, untested though base elements should be there

To do:
- Error handling
- Document usage
- Non blocking listen
- Clean up
- Bunch of stuff probably

Pico sdk used: 1.5.0
